Decided to set up a Kubernetes cluster for frontend and backend applications
(together with redis and postgresql) using minikube and Helm charts on MacOS

1. Installed minikube with brew cask install minikube
2. Created a cluster with "minikube start"
3. Installed helm with brew install kubernetes-helm
4. Created a service account for tiller with the correct role (using dashboard-adminuser.yaml)
5. Created a template helm chart with "helm create" with name "Frontback"
6. Configured the template helm chart to set up frontend and backend example applications 
7. Set up configuration variables and services to support deployment to minikube
8. Added redis chart as dependency, configured to turn off password authentication
9. Added postgresql chart as dependency, configured password for postgres user
10. Increased initialDelaySeconds for frontend livenessprobe to allow time to start
11. Configured backend to use postgresql and redis
12. Deployed the chart with "helm install"

After this, all the expected functionality works - links to backend, cache, and 
sending messages to database.
